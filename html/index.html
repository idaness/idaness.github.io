                    <p>Cities that have developed up to this day has not given much room for a very important and substantial part of what it means to be a living and breathing human being. Humans have their origins in nature and have lived off natural resources since the early days. Placing millions of humans in a concrete jungle with little to no green spaces is an unnatural habitat. It can cause problems not only harmful to the environment but also our physical and mental health. Studies from several renowned university institutions have concluded that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/space-increase-happiness/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; text-emphasis: strong;"><b>there is a strong correlation</b></a> between self-reported general happiness and physical health and ease of access to green spaces. According to UN’s recent estimates,<a href="https://www.who.int/sustainable-development/cities/health-risks/urban-green-space/en/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"><b> 3.3% of global deaths</b></a> are related to health implications caused by a lack of green spaces.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the health implications the lack of green spaces has for humans, the environmental conditions are also highly reliant on sufficient green spaces. All plants and trees produce oxygen and reduces CO2 levels, and also help filter out other air pollutants such as airborne dust particles. In a city such as Oslo, <a href="https://www.visitoslofjorden.no/destninasjoner-oslofjorden-ost/2019/1/15/oslo" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>the concentration of urban settlement</b></a> is very high in certain areas and air quality vary significantly between these depending on how much green spaces there are in these areas.</p>

                    <h2 class="underoverskrift">Oslo as the European Green Capital</h2>
                    <p>Oslo was elected as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/winning-cities/2019-oslo/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"><b>European Environmental Capital of 2019.</b></a> One of the reasons the city won this title, was the initiative to encourage emission free transport such as electric vehicles, cycling and the establishment of car free zones. However, although this is a great initiative, we believe Oslo has not fulfilled the full environmental potential that comes with this title. Especially in terms of urban green spaces, there is a lot more that could be done in order to create green lungs for the city. We in GreenUp believe that we must scale up the green urban initiative to create a truly better environment for Oslo’s inhabitants and animal life.</p>

                   <p>Making room for more green spaces in cities around the world is not a new thing. <a href="https://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/ml_gothein_history_garden_art_design/town_gardens_middle_ages" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Even in the medieval times</b></a>, garden plots and parks around town houses was a fairly normal sight. There is well documented evidence that people used to grow small plots of land with vegetables and fruits in larger urban areas in Europe. Either this was along the wall towards a river, or in backyards between town houses, their purpose back then was mainly for aesthetic or cultivational reasons. Today, there is very little vegetation in urban areas, and there is a need to reverse this trend. </p>

                            Large gravel roofs, like the ones often found in cities, absorb a lot of heat during warmer days. Because they are in direct sunlight, the temperatures of these rooftops gets very high. This warmth radiates back into the environment, making cities up to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-rooftop-garden/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"><b>3 to 5 celsius degrees warmer</b></a> than suburban areas, on hot days. More green rooftops will decrease the city temperature.

                        <p>
                            Rooftop gardens can also lead to <a href="https://www.globalchange.com/roof-gardens-impact-on-energy-saving.htm" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"><b>less and more effective use of energy.</b></a> By working as a natural layer of insulation, green roofs will help keep the heat inside the building during the winter, and the heat out during summer.

Therefore, there is a need to be extra mindful of which soil to use when building a roof garden. Because of this, we are introducing the green mat. This i a soil matt carefully engineered to mimic natural soil whilst simultaneously catering to an environment very differen from the ground. It consists of a carefully manufactured mix of minerals and organic matter, and a customizable blend of seeds to fit your particular desires. It simply needs to be rolled out, and rain water will do the rest of the job to activate the growth. Join us, and roll out your own gardens of herbs, lettuces, sprouts, or some of our other options. The mat can easily be fitted and installed to any outdoor surface, whether this is a flat or tilte roof, a wall, a veranda, or any other free surface.<br><br></p>
